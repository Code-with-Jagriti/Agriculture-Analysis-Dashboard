🌾 Agriculture Production Analysis
📌 Project Overview

Agriculture plays a vital role in the Indian economy, and analyzing crop production helps identify patterns, optimize resources, and plan better farming strategies. This project focuses on exploring agricultural data across multiple Indian states and seasons to study the relationship between area cultivated, rainfall, fertilizer, pesticide usage, and crop yield.

Using this dataset, I built an interactive Power BI dashboard that highlights production trends, state-wise contributions, and the major factors influencing yield. The goal of this project is to provide insights into how climatic factors and agricultural inputs affect crop production over time.

The dataset contains structured agricultural records with the following fields:

Crop – Type of crop grown (e.g., Maize, Arhar/Tur, Bajra, Arecanut, etc.)

Crop Year – Year of cultivation (1997–2020 in this dataset)

Season – Cultivation season (Kharif, Rabi, Autumn, etc.)

State – State in India where crop was cultivated

Area – Total cultivated area (hectares)

Production – Crop production output (tons)

Annual Rainfall – Rainfall received in the year (mm)

Fertilizer – Fertilizer usage (kg)

Pesticide – Pesticide usage (kg)

Yield – Ratio of production to cultivated area

This dataset provides a foundation to analyze how agricultural inputs and climatic conditions impact productivity across regions and years.

📈 Dashboard Highlights

The Power BI dashboard was designed to make the data interactive and insightful. Key highlights include:

🔹 High-level Metrics

Total Production: ~324 Billion

Total Cultivated Area: ~4 Billion

Sum of Annual Rainfall: ~28.31 Million mm

Average Yield: ~79.95

🔹 Visual Insights

Production Over Time

Crop production has steadily increased from the late 1990s to 2015, with some fluctuations caused by seasonal or climatic changes.

Peak production years recorded between 2010–2015.

State-wise Contribution

Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Andhra Pradesh emerged as top contributors.

States like Meghalaya and Assam showed smaller contributions but with noticeable influence from rainfall.

Rainfall & Yield Relationship

Rainfall is one of the strongest influencers of crop production.

For example, states like Meghalaya recorded significant increases in rainfall compared to others.

Impact of Fertilizers & Pesticides

Inputs like fertilizers and pesticides directly influenced yield efficiency.

Analysis helps understand how resource optimization can improve productivity.

🎯 Key Learnings

Crop production is highly influenced by climatic factors, especially rainfall.

States with larger cultivated areas and optimized fertilizer use showed higher productivity.

Seasonal variations play a big role in yield outcomes.

Dashboards make it easier to communicate complex agricultural data in a meaningful way.
